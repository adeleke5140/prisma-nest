## SubSteak API

This is REST API built with NestJS, Prisma, SQLite and Typescript for a blog application called Substeak.

I've heard great things about Nest and Prisma. I've also been learning some TS recently so I decided to build an API with it. The API documentation is on swagger.

Inspired by the helpful tutorial at Prisma docs.
